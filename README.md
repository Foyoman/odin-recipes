This project will be a bunch of recipes demonstrating what I've learnt about HTML. 
I will set up html documents in VSCode, including all necessary <head> elements and 
demonstrating <body> elements. I will be adding headers and paragraphs, emphasising and
"strong-ing" text, making unordered and ordered lists, and embedding links and images.
