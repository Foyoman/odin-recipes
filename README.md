This project will be a bunch of recipes demonstrating what I've learnt about HTML. 
I will set up html documents in VSCode, including all necessary &lt;head&gt; elements and 
demonstrative &lt;body&gt; elements. I will be adding headers and paragraphs, emphasising 
and &ldquo;strong-ing&rdquo; text, making unordered and ordered lists, and embedding links 
and images.
